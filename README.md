Description/Outline: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BACKGROUND CHECKS ACROSS STATES WITH OBLIGED AND NON OBLIGED BACKGROUND REQUIREMENT IN RELATION TO CRIME RATES DUE TO GUN DEATHS

### Research Questions:
 
   * What are the number of applicants that were approved or denied on background checks for Texas and California from 2013-2018?
   
   * What are the number of firearm purchases in Texas and California from 2013-2018?
   
   * What are the firearm related crime rates in Texas and California from 2013-2018?
   
   * What do the background checks, firearm purchases, and firearm related crime rates look like from 2013-2018?
   
   * Sources for datasets we used: [gunpolicy](https://www.gunpolicy.org/api), [bjs](https://www.bjs.gov/developer/ncvs/index.cfm) and [BuzzFeedNews](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks/tree/master/data).
   
### Tasks Breakdown:
   
   * Parse background check data to retrieve approvals and denials for Texas and California from 2013-2018, store in a table, and plot a line graph for each state      showing the time frame, approvals, and denials.
   
   * Parse firearm purchase data to retrieve total firearms sold in Texas and California from 2013-2018, store in a table, and plot each state’s result in a line      graph.
   
   * Parse firearm related crime rates in Texas and California from 2013-2018, store in a table, and plot each state’s result in a line graph.
   
   * Determine if there is a correlation between background checks and firearm related crimes by creating a scatter plots of Texas and California showing background    checks and firearm related crime rates.
   
   * Make graphs for each task.
