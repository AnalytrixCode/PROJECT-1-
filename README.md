What are the number of firearm related crimes?4. What do the checks, purchases, and crime rates look like over a 5 yr period?

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
1.Research firearm purchase data first looking at background checks, firearm purchases, and crimes.
2.Look at the data from two states...one that requires a background check and one that doesnâ€™t.
3.We can determine if there is a correlation between background checks andfirearm related crimes.
